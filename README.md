
# Spanish Speaking Assignment Program  

This program was created to help student study for spanish.
There are two sections of this code:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Practice Mode  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Assignment Mode.  
Practice mode will repeat all questions in a random order until
you turn off the program by pressing x and the enter key.
Assignment mode will ask all questions in a random order by topic once
and tell you when you are done with a short congratulation message.

This program was build with `Pycharm CE using python 3.8`.
I have included the Python script for anyone interested to see
how the program works or wish to tweak the program for their
liking.  
Libararies included:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`sys`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`playsound`  

`MP3` files were created in a seperate file using the `gTTS` (Google Text To Speech) library
which can be easilly installed using  

```bash
  pip install gTTS
```

or if you are on linux you can use this instead

```bash
  sudo apt-get install gTTS
```

command in your terminal. Bare in mind this libarary needs internet
access as it connects to google. if you're using CMD open it as an Administrator.

To export the `.py` file to an `.exe` file use `pyinstaller` which can be dowloaded by typing the following command in CMD (run as an Administrator):

```bash
  pip install pyinstaller
```

or if you are on linux:

```bash
  sudo apt-get install pyinstaller
```

Bare in mind this program may take a while to boot up on slower machines.
The CMD window will appear empty but do not worry. After a few minutes
it should boot up normally.  

I've tested this program on both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows systems and 64-bit Ubuntu (Linux system).

To use this program on linux you will need to boot it up from the terminal.
First:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right click on the directory your/path/to/SpanishSpeaking and pick "Open in terminal"  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the terminal and write:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`cd your/path/to/SpanishSpeaking`  

Then write the following command:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`./SpanishSpeaking.exe`

this command will run the `.exe` file.

Please do NOT move the exe file from the folder. It needs to be able access the MP3 files.
You can create a shortcut instead and move it to your desired location.

If you find any bugs inside the program please email me at:

NOTE: This is an old project from highschool, as seen by the timestamp above, developed by me to help me study for my spanish speaking assignment!  

While the code is very janky, I am still quite fond of this project and decided to share it.
